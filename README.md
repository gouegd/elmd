## What

Super simple webapp to turn markdown text, entered in a textarea, into the fancy HTML version it becomes.

Built with Elm, relies on the `elm-markdown` package which does all the work.

Super basic, no bells or whistle.
May be improved for fun or if I find something useful to do.

Try it [live on github pages](gouegd.github.io/elmd) !
